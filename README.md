# Integration Engineer Take Home Test

Thank you for your interest in the Fullstack Developer position at our company. This take-home test is designed to assess your skills in building a Node.js backend API and a ReactJS frontend. The test should be completed within a few hours. Please follow the instructions carefully.

## Task Description:

You are tasked with completing a simple task management application. This template provides a minimal setup to get a React frontent in Vite with HMR, that communicates to a Node/Express backend. Users should be able to view, create, update, and delete tasks.

There are several parts to the exercise. You will have to get the backend and frontend running (There may be slight problems that the original dev didn't run into because 'it works on his machine.'). Next, the endpoints for creating and deleting tasks must be completed. The React front end needs to have two functions completed that will interact with your new endpoints to create and delete tasks. Finally, you must implement a new endpoint in the Express app to update an existing task. You then must create a UI that allows an existing task to be updated, and communicates with your new endpoint.

*Additional Notes*

* The tasks should just live in memory, you don't need to implement any permanent storage. 
* You should not be able to create or update a task if the title or description is empty. Also, an error message should appear if the user attempts to submit an invalid task. (Your backend should accomodate this check as well, and return an error.)
* The previous dev left no notes on how to get the project running on a new machine. You'll need to use the existing files to figure it out (remember the dev might have left a mistake or two)
* The backend is written in JS, but the frontend React code is a .tsx file. Make sure everything you write is valid TS.
* The API must support CORS to allow cross-origin requests.
* The previous developer started some rudimentary styling of the app. The CSS should be updated as you see fit to make the UI more user friendly.
* BONUS: The frontend isn't the most efficient React app, which could lead to issues later. If you have any ideas on improving rendering, feel free to edit as needed.

*Submission Guidelines*

* Fork this GitHub repository to your own GitHub account.
* Develop the backend and frontend applications using the existing directory structure in the repo.
* Update this README below to provide clear instructions on how to run both the backend and frontend applications.
* Once completed, submit the link to your forked repository via email.

*Evaluation Criteria*

* Functionality: Does the application fulfill the specified requirements? Does it work without errors?
* Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, modular, and easy to understand?
* API Design: Is the API designed in a RESTful manner? Are error handling and validation implemented effectively?
* Frontend Design: Is the frontend intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing?
* Git Usage: Are commits meaningful and code changes well-tracked?
* Documentation: Is there clear documentation on how to get the app running on a new machine?

Remember that this is an opportunity for you to showcase your skills. Feel free to add any additional features or improvements you see fit.

Note: This test is designed to be completed within a few hours, but you are not limited by time. We value the quality of your work more than completing it quickly. If you have any questions or clarifications, feel free to reach out via email.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your submission!

Sincerely,
The Duda Solutions Engineering Team
